# Smoke-detector
<br>
Smoke sensors work by detecting the presence of smoke particles in the air. They consist of a chamber that contains a light source and a light detector. When smoke particles enter the chamber, they scatter the light from the source, causing a decrease in the amount of light detected by the light detector. This change in the amount of light is then processed by the sensor's circuitry, which triggers an alert, such as a loud alarm or a signal to a monitoring system.
